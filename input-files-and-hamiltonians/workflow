1) Create HF/MP2 orbitals in chosen basis in .molden format using PySCF with scripts provided in scrips/
2) Convert .molden files to CASINO readable format using utils/wfn_converters/molden/molden2qmc.py from CASINO installation
3a) Pre-optimize Jastrow factor in case of Variance minimization. For details write dobrautz@chalmers.se
3) Optimize Jastrow factor (specified in the parameters.casl files) with CASINO. Needs converted molden file and input file (samples given in subfolders)
4) Use the TCHInt library to produce TC Hamiltonian in second quantization. Need .molden file and optimized Jastrow factor (parameters.x.casl). Outputs 2- and 3-body integrals in FCIDUMP and TCDUMP format.
5) Use TC-VarQITE (on quantum hardware) or TC-FCIQMC method (on conventional hardware) to solve for ground state
